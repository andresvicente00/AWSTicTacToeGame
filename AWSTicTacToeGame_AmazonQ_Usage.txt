How Amazon Q Developer Was Used in Building the App

Amazon Q Developer was used to simplify the development process for the AWSTicTacToeGame. It provided tools and resources to:
1. Streamline the setup and hosting of the application on AWS, ensuring easy deployment.
2. Enable smooth integration with AWS services for scalability and reliability.

Since this version of the game is for two players only, Amazon Q Developer primarily supported the backend and deployment aspects of the application.
